  -breakfast''. Moreover, you can combine these AND/OR/exclude conditions like ''(morning
  OR night) sleepy -breakfast''.

  If you want to search for a sequence of words (e.g., a sentence), you must put it
  in double quotes, not to make it an AND search: "Today I learned"

    to tell if they want to see your posts or follow you.
  step3_1: Now it's time to follow some people!
  step3_2: 'Your home and social timelines are based off of who you follow, so try
    following a couple accounts to get started.

    Click the plus circle on the top right of a profile to follow them.'
  step4_1: Let's get you out there.
  step4_2: For your first post, some people like to make an {introduction} post or
    a simple "Hello world!"
  step5_1: Timelines, timelines everywhere!
  step5_2: Your server has {timelines} different timelines enabled.
  step5_3: The Home {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from the accounts you
    follow.
  step5_4: The Local {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from everyone else
    on this server.
  step5_5: The Social {icon} timeline is a combination of the Home and Local timelines.
  step5_6: The Recommended {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from servers
    the admins recommend.
  step5_7: The Global {icon} timeline is where you can see posts from every other
    connected server.
  step6_1: So, what is this place?
  step6_2: Well, you didn't just join fedired. You joined a portal to the Fediverse,
    an interconnected network of thousands of servers.
  step6_3: Each server works in different ways, and not all servers run fedired. This
    one does though! It's a bit complicated, but you'll get the hang of it in no time.
  step6_4: Now go, explore, and have fun!
